/coc/flash5/sanisetty3/miniconda3/envs/tgm3d/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/nn/utils/weight_norm.py:28: UserWarning: torch.nn.utils.weight_norm is deprecated in favor of torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.weight_norm.
  warnings.warn("torch.nn.utils.weight_norm is deprecated in favor of torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.weight_norm.")
Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration. Please open a PR/issue to update `preprocessor_config.json` to use `image_processor_type` instead of `feature_extractor_type`. This warning will be removed in v4.40.
