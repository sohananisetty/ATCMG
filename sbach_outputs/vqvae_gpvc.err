Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration. Please open a PR/issue to update `preprocessor_config.json` to use `image_processor_type` instead of `feature_extractor_type`. This warning will be removed in v4.40.
